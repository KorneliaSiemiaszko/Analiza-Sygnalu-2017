Unfortunatelly the information you request is not easily accessible through internet without a password:  
all the courses are on a separate platform. You can confirm I am teaching at Univerity of Social Sciences  
and Humanitiesby by writing to `dziekan@swps.edu.pl`. I am giving classes on EEG Signal Analysis  
("Analiza Sygnału EEG"), my name is Mikołaj Magnuski. I previously taught with matlab but switched to python lately.
